## Under Design

please check the repository issues and pull requests
to see what we have so far. This Library Carpentry lesson introduces people working in library- and information-related roles to working with MARC data in MarcEdit. At the conclusion of the lesson you will understand what the MarcEdit software does and how to use the MarcEdit software to work with MARC data files.
Contributions are very welcome**
