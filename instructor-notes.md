## Lesson Facilitation Tips

- Instructors are encouraged to teach the lesson on a PC. Best attempts have been made to add instructor notes where the Mac UI and functionality of MarcEdit differs.
- This lesson does not account for introduction time. If teaching this lesson as a standalone workshop, allot additional time for Library Carpentry overview and other icreaker introductions.
- When taught by two instructors, a natural split for handoff is lesson 7, with the first instructor teaching lessons 1-6, and the second teaching 7-10,
- It is suggested you provide ample set up support prior to the lesson to ensure learners have MarcEdit installed and the data file downloaded. Offering a set up drop-in an hour ahead of lesson to support MarcEdit installation/troubleshooting makes the rest of the lesson run much more smoothly. 
- If teaching this workshop online, opening a zoom breakout room at the start of the worksh is helpful for troubleshooting as required.
- When teaching online, emphasize that having a second screen is ideal for this workshop. Sharing a single-screen layout at the start of the lesson will support those who do not have access to a second screen.
