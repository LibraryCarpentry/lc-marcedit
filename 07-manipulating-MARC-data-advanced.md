## Building a MARC field

Sometimes it is necessary to create a new MARC field based on the content of existing MARC fields.
This is possible using the function called, Build New Field.

## RDA Helper

Records aren't created equal in that we encounter MARC data that follows different descriptive cataloging standards. There are a number of records cataloged according to the AACR2 standard or even AACR or earlier. Sometimes it is necessary to make sure these records follow the current RDA descriptive cataloging standard. MarcEdit lets you do this through the function called RDA Helper.

To run the RDA Helper, go to Tools and select RDA Helper. In the window that opens, you can pick and choose how you would like to transform your records to align better with the RDA descriptive standard. For example, you can add the RDA fields 336, 337, and 338 for content, media, and carrier types. You can update the MARC field 040 to include the `$e` rda and delete the GMD statement. You can also evaluate the 260/264.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Run the RDA Helper on your MARC data

1. Run the RDA Helper with these settings: Add 336, 337, 338; Modify the 040; Evaluate the 260/264; Always use the copyright symbol; Expand abbreviations; Remove the GMD.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

1. Go to Tools in the upper menu in the MarcEditor
2. Select RDA Helper
3. Check off the settings listed above
4. Click the OK button.
5. Check your MARC data. Do you see the changes?

## Select Records to Edit

There are times when you need to work on a subset of your MARC data. The Select Records for Edit function allows you do this.

Before using the Select Records for Edit function, save your file to capture recent edits.

Go to File and click on Select Records for Edit. In the window, you will see Display Field in the lower right hand corner. This is where you enter the MARC field you want to see displayed once you import your file. You can enter a MARC field and subfield or just a MARC field. The MARC field and/or subfield that you add in this box will provide the criteria you need to select records you want to edit. Once you have entered the Display Field, click on Import File. This will import the MARC (`.mrk`) file that you are currently working on. You can select another MARC (`.mrk`) file in the box Source MARC file.

To select only the records you want to edit, enter your criteria in the Search box and click the magnifying glass icon. Records in your file where the contents of the selected Display Field match your search criteria will be selected. Click on Export Selected to export these records and edit them.

When saving the exported records you can choose to save the file as a new record subset (Save As), or merge the edits back into your complete record set (Save).
