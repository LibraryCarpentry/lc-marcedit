## What is MarcEdit?

MarcEdit is a suite of tools created and maintained by Terry Reese. The tools together form the MarcEdit software which can be used to create, edit and work with library metadata, particularly (although not limited to) records in MARC format. MarcEdit can be used to

* make small, single, edits to individual MARC records
* make edits across many MARC records at a single time
* automate commmon processes using macros
* validate your data against MARC rules
* convert data between different formats for bibliographic data
* enhance your data and pull data from external sources

[A list of features is available on the MarcEdit website](https://marcedit.reeset.net/features).

Although the ability to create, view and edit MARC records is built into many pieces of library and bibliographic management software, MarcEdit is particularly flexible and powerful for editing MARC data as well as offering integration with other software and services. With MarcEdit's wideranging functionality and integration into other library services it is a very powerful toolkit for anyone working with bibliographic data.
